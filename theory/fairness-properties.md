</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Fair division algorithms are evaluated against rigorous mathematical criteria that formalize our intuitive notions of fairness. This framework provides the theoretical foundation for comparing algorithms and understanding the trade-offs between different fairness guarantees.</p>
  <p>Each property represents a different way to answer the fundamental question: <em>"What makes a division fair?"</em> Some properties focus on individual satisfaction, others on relative comparisons, and still others on strategic considerations.</p>

  <h2>Core Fairness Properties</h2>
  <div class="properties-grid">

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Proportionality</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Individual Rationality</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">Minimum Guarantee</span>
      </div>

      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> Each player receives at least their "fair share" according to their own valuation.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> For $n$ players, player $i$ receives at least $\frac{1}{n}$ of their subjective valuation:</p>

      $$v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq \frac{v_i(\text{total})}{n}$$

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Proportionality ensures no player leaves feeling they received less than their "due." It's often considered the minimum acceptable fairness criterion.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Players might still prefer others' allocations even when receiving proportional shares. A player could receive exactly $\frac{1}{n}$ while another receives $\frac{n-1}{n}$.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Algorithm Examples:</strong> Divide-and-Choose, Steinhaus Lone-Divider, Banach-Knaster</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Envy-Freeness</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Preference Satisfaction</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">Relative Fairness</span>
      </div>

      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> No player would prefer to trade their allocation for someone else's.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> For all players $i$ and $j$:</p>

      $$v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq v_i(\text{piece}_j)$$

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Relationship to Proportionality:</strong> Envy-freeness implies proportionality. If player $i$ doesn't envy anyone, and there are $n$ players total, then $v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq v_i(\text{piece}_j)$ for all $j$. Since the pieces partition the whole cake: $\sum_{j=1}^n v_i(\text{piece}_j) = v_i(\text{total})$. Therefore: $n \cdot v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq \sum_{j=1}^n v_i(\text{piece}_j) = v_i(\text{total})$, which gives us $v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq \frac{v_i(\text{total})}{n}$.</p>
        <p><strong>Converse Not True:</strong> Proportionality doesn't imply envy-freeness. Consider: Player 1 values pieces A and B equally at 50 each, receives A. Player 2 receives piece B but Player 1 values B at 60 and A at 40. Player 1 is proportional (≥50) but envious.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Algorithm Examples:</strong> Divide-and-Choose, Austin's Moving Knife, Selfridge-Conway</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Equitability</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Equal Satisfaction</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">Interpersonal Comparison</span>
      </div>

      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> All players are equally satisfied with their allocations.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> All players value their received pieces equally:</p>

      $$v_1(\text{piece}_1) = v_2(\text{piece}_2) = \cdots = v_n(\text{piece}_n)$$

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Philosophical Challenge:</strong> Equitability requires comparing utility across different people, which raises deep questions about interpersonal utility comparison. Can we meaningfully say that Alice's satisfaction of "75 points" equals Bob's satisfaction of "75 points"?</p>
    
        <p><strong>Practical Implementation:</strong> Most algorithms assume utilities are measured on comparable scales (e.g., both players' total valuations sum to 100), making equitability operationally meaningful.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Relationship to Other Properties:</strong> Equitability neither implies nor is implied by envy-freeness. Players can be equally satisfied but still envy each other if they value others' pieces higher than their own.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Algorithm Examples:</strong> Austin's Moving Knife, Adjusted Winner</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Strategy-Proofness</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Incentive Compatibility</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">Mechanism Design</span>
      </div>

      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> Players cannot benefit by misrepresenting their true preferences.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> Truth-telling is a dominant strategy. For any player $i$, any false valuation $v_i'$, and any valuations $v_{-i}$ of other players:</p>

      $$u_i(\text{outcome}(v_i, v_{-i})) \geq u_i(\text{outcome}(v_i', v_{-i}))$$

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Implementation Challenge:</strong> Many fairness properties become much harder to achieve when players might lie about their preferences. Strategy-proofness ensures the algorithm works correctly even with strategic players.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Revelation Principle:</strong> For any mechanism, there exists an equivalent strategy-proof mechanism that yields the same outcomes. This justifies focusing on strategy-proof algorithms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example of Non-Strategy-Proof Mechanism:</strong> "Highest bidder wins" auction isn't strategy-proof because players benefit from underbidding. In contrast, second-price auctions are strategy-proof.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Algorithm Examples:</strong> Austin's Moving Knife</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Exactness</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Precise Equality</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">Strong Fairness</span>
      </div>
    
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> The division achieves perfect mathematical equality rather than just inequality bounds.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> Players receive exactly their proportional share:</p>

      $$v_i(\text{piece}_i) = \frac{v_i(\text{total})}{n} \text{ for all players } i$$

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Discrete vs. Continuous:</strong> Exact divisions typically require continuous procedures. Discrete algorithms can only approximate exactness to within their precision limits.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Existence Theory:</strong> The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that exact divisions exist for continuous valuation functions. For any player's continuous valuation $v_i$ on interval $[0,1]$, there exists a cut position $x^*$ such that $v_i([0,x^*]) = \frac{v_i([0,1])}{2}$.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> Exact algorithms often require infinite precision, making them theoretically elegant but practically challenging to implement.</p>
      </div>
    
      <p><strong>Algorithm Examples:</strong> Austin's Moving Knife, Continuous Moving Knife procedures</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Pareto Efficiency</h3>
      <div class="property-meta">
        <span class="meta-badge property">Social Optimality</span>
        <span class="meta-badge property">No Waste</span>
      </div>
    
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Intuition:</strong> No alternative allocation could make someone better off without making someone else worse off.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> An allocation is Pareto efficient if there exists no other allocation where:</p>

      $$v_i(\text{piece}_i') \geq v_i(\text{piece}_i) \text{ for all } i \text{ and } v_j(\text{piece}_j') > v_j(\text{piece}_j) \text{ for some } j$$
    
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Tension with Other Properties:</strong> Pareto efficiency can conflict with fairness properties. The allocation "Player 1 gets everything" is Pareto efficient but violates proportionality and envy-freeness.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Implementation Difficulty:</strong> Many simple fair division algorithms are not Pareto efficient. For example, Divide-and-Choose might create allocations where both players could be made better off through trades.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Social Choice Implications:</strong> The Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics suggests that any Pareto efficient allocation can be achieved through market mechanisms, but this requires initial endowments and may not preserve fairness.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Most classical fair division algorithms do not guarantee Pareto efficiency, representing an important area for algorithmic improvement.</p>

  <h2>Property Relationships & Implications</h2>
  <h3>Hierarchy of Fairness</h3>
  <p>Understanding how these properties relate helps in algorithm design and evaluation:</p>
  <div class="relationship-diagram">

    <div class="relationship-item">
      <h4>Envy-Free ⟹ Proportional</h4>
      <p>Every envy-free allocation is proportional, but proportional allocations may still have envy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relationship-item">
      <h4>Exact ⟹ Proportional</h4>
      <p>Exact equality automatically satisfies proportionality requirements.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="relationship-item">
      <h4>Equitable ⊄ Envy-Free</h4>
      <p>Players can be equally satisfied but still prefer others' allocations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relationship-item">
      <h4>Strategy-Proof ⊥ Others</h4>
      <p>Strategy-proofness is largely independent of outcome-based fairness properties.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Impossibility Results</h3>
  <p>Some combinations of properties cannot be simultaneously achieved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proportional + Pareto Efficient:</strong> Not always compatible with finite discrete algorithms</li>
    <li><strong>Envy-Free + Pareto Efficient:</strong> Difficult to achieve simultaneously in general settings</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy-Proof + Efficient:</strong> The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem suggests limitations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Computational Considerations</h2>
  <h3>Query Complexity by Property</h3>
  <p>Different fairness properties require different amounts of information from players:</p>
  <div class="complexity-analysis">

    <div class="complexity-item">
      <h4>Proportional Division</h4>
      <p><strong>Lower Bound:</strong> n-1 queries for n players</p>
      <p><strong>Optimal Algorithm:</strong> Divide-and-Choose (2 queries for 2 players)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complexity-item">
      <h4>Envy-Free Division</h4>
      <p><strong>Lower Bound:</strong> n queries for n players</p>
      <p><strong>Best Known:</strong> Selfridge-Conway for 3 players</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complexity-item">
      <h4>Exact Division</h4>
      <p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Requires continuous procedures (infinite queries)</p>
      <p><strong>Practical Approximation:</strong> Discrete algorithms with high precision</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <h3>Algorithm Design Trade-offs</h3>
  <p>Algorithm designers must balance multiple considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fairness vs. Efficiency:</strong> Stronger fairness often requires more queries</li>
    <li><strong>Simplicity vs. Optimality:</strong> Simple algorithms may sacrifice some properties</li>
    <li><strong>Discrete vs. Continuous:</strong> Practical implementation vs. theoretical elegance</li>
    <li><strong>Robustness vs. Performance:</strong> Strategy-proofness may limit achievable outcomes</li>
  </ul>
