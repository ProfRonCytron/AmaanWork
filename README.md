# Fair Division Algorithms: Interactive Research Platform

An academic Jekyll website developing interactive educational resources for fair division theory research and pedagogy.

## Current Status

**In Active Development** - This project is in early stages with foundational algorithms implemented and additional content planned.

## Quick Start

Click [here](https://amaan-19.github.io/fair-division-exercises/) to view the site!

## Technology Stack

- **Jekyll 4.x** - Static site generator optimized for academic content
- **GitHub Pages** - Deployment target (configured in Gemfile)
- **Custom CSS** - Academic typography with Inter + Crimson Text fonts
- **MathJax 3** - Mathematical notation rendering
- **Interactive HTML/JS** - Custom demonstrations embedded via iframes

## Features

### Mathematical Rigor
- Formal proofs for algorithm properties
- LaTeX-style mathematical notation via MathJax
- Academic formatting with proper citations

### Interactive Learning
Interactive geometric visualization where users can:
  - Adjust player valuations for colored regions
  - Position cutting lines with real-time feedback
  - Experience the full algorithm workflow
  - See mathematical properties verified

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS with academic typography
- Card-based algorithm catalog
- Accessible color schemes and proper contrast

## Development Notes

### Content Creation
- All algorithm pages use Markdown with YAML front matter
- Mathematical expressions use standard LaTeX syntax
- Interactive demos are standalone HTML files embedded via iframes

### Styling
- Custom CSS design system in `assets/main.css`
- Academic color palette with blue/gray scheme
- Responsive grid layouts for algorithm cards
- CSS assistance provided by Claude Sonnet 4
