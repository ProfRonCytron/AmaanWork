# Fair Division Algorithms: Interactive Research Platform

An academic Jekyll website developing interactive educational resources for fair division theory research and pedagogy.

## Current Status

**In Active Development** - This project is in early stages with foundational algorithms implemented and additional content planned.

### What's Working
- âœ… Jekyll site with academic styling and responsive design
- âœ… **Divide-and-Choose** algorithm with complete mathematical analysis
- âœ… Interactive geometric demo for Divide-and-Choose
- âœ… **Austin's Moving Knife** algorithm overview (basic implementation)
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design with modern UI components
- âœ… MathJax integration for mathematical notation

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ References and bibliography section (currently placeholder)
- ðŸ”„ Additional fair division algorithms
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced interactive demonstrations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.7+ with bundler
- Git

### Installation
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd fair-division-algorithms
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

## Technology Stack

- **Jekyll 4.x** - Static site generator optimized for academic content
- **GitHub Pages** - Deployment target (configured in Gemfile)
- **Custom CSS** - Academic typography with Inter + Crimson Text fonts
- **MathJax 3** - Mathematical notation rendering
- **Interactive HTML/JS** - Custom demonstrations embedded via iframes

## Features

### Mathematical Rigor
- Formal proofs for algorithm properties (proportionality, envy-freeness, strategy-proofness)
- LaTeX-style mathematical notation via MathJax
- Academic formatting with proper citations

### Interactive Learning
- **Divide-and-Choose Demo**: Interactive geometric visualization where users can:
  - Adjust player valuations for colored regions
  - Position cutting lines with real-time feedback
  - Experience the full algorithm workflow
  - See mathematical properties verified

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS with academic typography
- Card-based algorithm catalog
- Accessible color schemes and proper contrast

## Development Notes

### Content Creation
- All algorithm pages use Markdown with YAML front matter
- Mathematical expressions use standard LaTeX syntax
- Interactive demos are standalone HTML files embedded via iframes

### Styling
- Custom CSS design system in `assets/main.css`
- Academic color palette with blue/gray scheme
- Responsive grid layouts for algorithm cards
