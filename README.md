# Fair Division Algorithms

An interactive educational platform for learning fair division algorithms through hands-on demonstrations and mathematical analysis.

## About

This project teaches fair division theoryâ€”the mathematical study of dividing resources fairly among multiple parties. Students can run algorithms directly in their browser and explore the mathematical properties through interactive examples.

**Status:** Early development with one complete algorithm

## Current Features

- **Divide-and-Choose Algorithm** - Complete with interactive Python demo
- **Live code execution** - Python runs directly in browser via Pyodide
- **Mathematical rigor** - Formal definitions, theorems, and proofs
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## Technology

- Jekyll static site generator
- Pyodide for browser-based Python
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- GitHub Pages hosting

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd fair-division-algorithms
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

### GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main`
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/fair-division-algorithms`

## Coming Soon

- Austin's Moving-Knife Procedure
- Selfridge-Conway Algorithm
- Exercise problems and solutions
- Enhanced visualizations

## Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with WebAssembly support
- JavaScript enabled
- Note: Python environment takes 5-10 seconds to load initially

## Team

- **Amaan Khan** - Development
- **Dr. Ron Cytron** - Academic guidance
- **Mozilla** - Project support
