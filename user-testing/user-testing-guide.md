# User Testing Tasks (15 minutes)

## Background
You're testing a platform that teaches "fair division algorithms" - mathematical procedures for dividing resources fairly between people.

## Tasks (Try to think aloud as you work)

### Task 1: First Impressions (2 minutes)
- Visit the homepage
- What do you think this site is about?
- Where would you start as a new visitor?

### Task 2: Try an Algorithm (8 minutes)
- Navigate to the interactive demo
- Select "Divide-and-Choose" algorithm
- Try to understand what the colored regions represent
- Adjust some player values and observe changes
- Run the algorithm and see the result
- Questions to consider:
    - What is the algorithm trying to accomplish?
    - What do the "fairness properties" mean?
    - Was the process clear?

### Task 3: Find Information (3 minutes)
- Try to find: What does "envy-free" mean?
- Try to find: How many steps does Divide-and-Choose require?
- Was this information easy to locate?

### Task 4: Overall Assessment (2 minutes)
- Would this help you learn about algorithms?
- What was most/least clear?
- Any suggestions?
