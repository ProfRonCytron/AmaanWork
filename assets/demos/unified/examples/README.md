### `algorithm-template.js` (Future)
Boilerplate template for quickly creating new algorithms.

## Implementation Checklist
When creating a new algorithm:
- [ ] Extend BaseAlgorithm with proper config
- [ ] Implement all abstract methods
- [ ] Add algorithm-specific validation
- [ ] Define UI control requirements
- [ ] Use shared calculation engine for geometry
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Include step-by-step execution support
- [ ] Write unit tests
