# Algorithm Implementation Examples

This directory contains reference implementations and templates for building algorithms in the unified demo system.

## Files

### `simple-divide-and-choose.js`
Complete example implementation showing how to:
- Extend the BaseAlgorithm class
- Implement all required abstract methods
- Handle step-by-step execution
- Integrate with UnifiedGameState
- Provide UI control specifications
- Use caching and events

**Note**: This is a simplified reference implementation. The actual Divide-and-Choose algorithm should use the shared calculation engine for geometric calculations.

### `algorithm-template.js` (Future)
Boilerplate template for quickly creating new algorithms.

## Implementation Checklist
When creating a new algorithm:
- [ ] Extend BaseAlgorithm with proper config
- [ ] Implement all abstract methods
- [ ] Add algorithm-specific validation
- [ ] Define UI control requirements
- [ ] Use shared calculation engine for geometry
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Include step-by-step execution support
- [ ] Write unit tests
