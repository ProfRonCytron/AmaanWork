  <!-- Overview -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Developed by William F. Lucas in the 1990s, the Method of Markers provides a fair division procedure for goods that can be arranged in a linear fashion. This applies to both continuous resources (like a gold chain to be cut) and collections of discrete indivisible items (like books arranged on a shelf). The algorithm builds on ideas from the Last-Diminisher procedure but adapts them for indivisible or semi-divisible goods.</p>

    <p>Each player places markers to indicate segments they would accept as fair, with the algorithm ensuring everyone receives a proportional share according to their own valuation.</p>

  <!-- Mathematical Framework -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Mathematical Framework</h2>

    <p><strong>Formal Setup:</strong> Let $G$ be the set of goods arranged linearly, and let $v_i: \mathcal{P}(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ be player $i$'s valuation function where $\mathcal{P}(G)$ represents all possible subsets (segments) of $G$.</p>

    <p><strong>Marker Constraint:</strong> For each player $i$, their markers $m_i^1 < m_i^2 < \ldots < m_i^{n-1}$ must satisfy:
    $$v_i(\text{segment}_j) \geq \frac{v_i(G)}{n} \text{ for all segments } j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$</p>

    <p><strong>Allocation Function:</strong> The algorithm produces allocation $A = (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n)$ where $A_i$ is the segment received by player $i$.</p>

  <!-- Fairness Properties -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Fairness Properties</h2>

    <h3>Proportionality</h3>
    <p>Every player receives at least their proportional share according to their own valuation.</p>
    <div class="proof-sketch">
      <div class="proof-sketch-header" onclick="toggleProof('proportionality-proof')">
        <span><strong>Formal Statement:</strong> $\forall i, v_i(A_i) \geq \frac{v_i(G)}{n}$</span>
        <span class="proof-toggle">‚ñº</span>
      </div>
      <div id="proportionality-proof" class="proof-sketch-content">
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> By the marker placement constraint, each player values every segment they create as worth at least $\frac{1}{n}$ of the total.</p>
        
        <p>When player $i$ is selected in any round, they receive a segment that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ends at one of their own markers, and</li>
          <li>Contains at least one complete segment they originally marked</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Since player $i$ valued this segment as $\geq \frac{v_i(G)}{n}$ when placing markers, and they may receive additional goods beyond their marker, we have $v_i(A_i) \geq \frac{v_i(G)}{n}$.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Strategy-Proofness</h3>
    <p>Truth-telling when placing markers is a dominant strategy.</p>
    <div class="proof-sketch">
      <div class="proof-sketch-header" onclick="toggleProof('strategy-proof')">
        <span><strong>Intuition:</strong> Misreporting preferences cannot improve outcomes</span>
        <span class="proof-toggle">‚ñº</span>
      </div>
      <div id="strategy-proof" class="proof-content">
        <p>Players cannot benefit from placing markers dishonestly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Over-claiming:</strong> Placing markers to claim segments worth less than $\frac{1}{n}$ risks receiving an inadequate allocation</li>
          <li><strong>Under-claiming:</strong> Being overly conservative may result in receiving less desirable segments</li>
          <li><strong>Optimal strategy:</strong> Place markers to create segments of exactly equal value $\frac{v_i(G)}{n}$</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Remainder Efficiency</h3>
    <p>The algorithm may leave surplus goods that are distributed to the remaining players, improving overall efficiency.</p>

  <!-- Computational Complexity -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Computational Complexity</h2>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h4>Time Complexity</h4>
      <p><strong>Marker Placement Phase:</strong> Each player must determine optimal marker positions, which requires evaluating potential segments. For continuous goods, this can be done in $O(1)$ time per marker using calculus. For discrete goods, this may require $O(m)$ time where $m$ is the number of items.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Allocation Phase:</strong> Finding the leftmost marker in each round takes $O(n)$ time, with $n$ rounds total, giving $O(n^2)$ for the allocation phase.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Overall:</strong> $O(n \cdot m + n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of players and $m$ is the number of discrete items (or $O(n^2)$ for continuous goods).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h4>Information Requirements</h4>
      <p>Unlike query-based algorithms, the Method of Markers requires players to compute and report their complete preferences through marker placement. This is more information-intensive than procedures using Robertson-Webb queries.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Practical Considerations -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>

    <h3>Applicability</h3>
    <p>The Method of Markers is particularly well-suited for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear Resources:</strong> Gold chains, ribbons, linear plots of land</li>
      <li><strong>Ordered Collections:</strong> Books on shelves, sequential time slots, adjacent seating arrangements</li>
      <li><strong>Modular Systems:</strong> Where goods naturally form contiguous segments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <div class="property-card">
      <h4>Linearity Requirement</h4>
      <p>The algorithm only works when goods can be meaningfully arranged in a linear order. This excludes many practical scenarios with heterogeneous goods that don't have natural ordering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h4>Contiguity Constraint</h4>
      <p>Players can only receive contiguous segments, which may be inefficient if their preferences are non-contiguous (e.g., preferring alternating items).</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Historical Context -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Historical Context</h2>

    <p>William F. Lucas developed this procedure around 1994 as part of research into fair division of indivisible goods. The algorithm represents an important bridge between continuous fair division procedures (like the moving knife methods) and discrete allocation mechanisms.</p>

    <p>Lucas's contribution was recognizing that many practical fair division problems involve goods that are neither perfectly divisible nor completely independent‚Äîthey have some linear structure that can be exploited for fair allocation.</p>

  <!-- Extensions and Variants -->
  <section class="content-block">
    <h2>Extensions and Variants</h2>

    <h3>Weighted Proportionality</h3>
    <p>The basic algorithm can be modified to handle situations where players have different entitlements. Player $i$ with weight $w_i$ places markers to create segments worth $\frac{w_i \cdot v_i(G)}{\sum_j w_j}$ each.</p>

    <h3>Approximate Implementations</h3>
    <p>For very large discrete collections, players might place markers approximately, trading perfect proportionality for computational efficiency.</p>
