  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Cake-Cutting</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A mathematical metaphor for fair division problems involving the allocation of a heterogeneous, divisible resource among multiple parties. The "cake" represents any continuous resource where different parts may have different values to different people.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Envy-Free</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A fairness property where no player prefers another player's allocation to their own. Mathematically: $v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq v_i(\text{piece}_j)$ for all players $i$ and $j$.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Moving Knife</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A continuous procedure in fair division where a knife moves across a cake and players can call for it to stop when certain conditions are met. This enables more precise divisions compared to discrete cutting procedures.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Proportional</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A fairness property guaranteeing that each player receives at least their proportional share of the total value. For $n$ players, each must receive at least $\frac{1}{n}$ of their subjective valuation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Strategy-Proof</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A fairness property where truth-telling is a dominant strategy for all players. No player can benefit by misrepresenting their true preferences or valuations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="term-card">
    <h3 class="term-name">Valuation Function</h3>
    <p class="term-definition">
      A mathematical function $v_i(S)$ that represents how much player $i$ values a given piece $S$ of the resource. These functions are typically normalized so the entire resource has value 100 or 1.
