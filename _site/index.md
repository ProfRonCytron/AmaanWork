### Key Concepts

**Fair Division** is the problem of dividing resources among multiple parties in a way that satisfies certain fairness criteria:

- **Proportionality**: Each player receives at least 1/n of their subjective value
- **Envy-freeness**: No player prefers another player's allocation to their own
- **Strategy-proofness**: Players have no incentive to misrepresent their preferences

### Featured Algorithm

The **Divide-and-Choose** algorithm demonstrates these concepts beautifully:

1. One player divides the resource
2. The other player chooses their preferred piece
3. The divider gets the remaining piece

This simple procedure guarantees both proportionality and envy-freeness for two players!
