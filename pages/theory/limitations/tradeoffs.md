  <p class="page-description">Why you can't have it all: fundamental conflicts between fairness properties</p>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h2>The Fundamental Tension</h2>
  <p>In fair division, as in life, you can't always have everything you want. Different fairness properties often conflict with each other, forcing algorithm designers to make difficult choices about which properties to prioritize.</p>
  <p>Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for selecting appropriate algorithms and setting realistic expectations for what fairness can achieve in practice.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Major Trade-off Categories</h2>

  <div class="properties-grid">
    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Fairness vs. Efficiency</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>The Core Tension:</strong> Ensuring fairness often prevents achieving maximum total welfare.
      </p>

      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Classic Example:</strong> Two players, one cake. Player 1 loves chocolate and values the entire cake at 100. Player 2 is allergic to chocolate and values it at 0.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pareto Efficient Solution:</strong> Give everything to Player 1 (total welfare = 100)</p>
        <p><strong>Fair Solution:</strong> Split 50-50 (total welfare = 50, but Player 2 gets proportional share)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Mathematical Formalization:</strong> Let $W = \sum_i v_i(\text{piece}_i)$ be total welfare. Pareto efficiency maximizes $W$, but fairness constraints like $v_i(\text{piece}_i) \geq \frac{1}{n} v_i(\text{total})$ can force $W$ to be suboptimal.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Resolution Strategies:</strong> Weighted fairness, constrained efficiency, or lexicographic optimization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Strategy-Proofness vs. Optimality</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>The Incentive Problem:</strong> Preventing manipulation often limits achievable outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Intuition:</strong> To make an algorithm strategy-proof, you often have to "waste" some potential by not fully optimizing based on reported preferences, since those preferences might be lies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> In second-price auctions, the winner pays the second-highest bid rather than their own bid. This ensures truthful bidding but doesn't extract maximum revenue.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fair Division Context:</strong> Many optimal fair division procedures become manipulable when players can misreport preferences. Making them strategy-proof often requires suboptimal allocations.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Common Approaches:</strong> Mechanism design theory, randomization, or restricted preference domains.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Simplicity vs. Fairness</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Complexity Creep:</strong> Stronger fairness properties often require more complex algorithms.
      </p>
      
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Progression Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proportional (2 players):</strong> Divide-and-Choose (2 queries, 2 steps)</li>
          <li><strong>Envy-free (2 players):</strong> Divide-and-Choose (same - coincidence!)</li>
          <li><strong>Envy-free (3 players):</strong> Selfridge-Conway (complex, multi-phase)</li>
          <li><strong>Envy-free (n players):</strong> No known bounded finite algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Query Complexity Growth:</strong> Stronger fairness properties typically require more queries, making algorithms harder to implement and understand.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong> Simple algorithms are easier to explain, implement, and gain acceptance, even if they achieve weaker fairness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Precision vs. Computability</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>The Discrete Barrier:</strong> Exact fairness often requires infinite precision.
      </p>
      
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Exactness Challenge:</strong> Achieving perfect 50-50 splits requires finding cuts at positions that may be irrational numbers, requiring infinite precision to specify exactly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Computational Reality:</strong> Real computers have finite precision, making truly exact algorithms impossible to implement.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Approximation Trade-off:</strong> $\epsilon$-fair algorithms achieve fairness within $\epsilon$ but require $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ computational resources.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Accept approximation, use symbolic computation, or employ continuous procedures with stopping criteria.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Individual vs. Group Optimality</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Competing Perspectives:</strong> What's fair for individuals may not optimize group outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Envy-freeness Focus:</strong> Ensures no individual feels wronged, but may not maximize collective satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Utilitarian Alternative:</strong> Maximize $\sum_i v_i(\text{piece}_i)$ (total utility) but may leave some players feeling unfairly treated.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Egalitarian Tension:</strong> Minimize $\max_i v_i(\text{piece}_i) - \min_j v_j(\text{piece}_j)$ (reduce inequality) but may reduce overall welfare.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Philosophical Question:</strong> Should algorithms prioritize individual rights or collective welfare when they conflict?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="property-card">
      <h3>Robustness vs. Performance</h3>
      <p class="property-description">
        <strong>Worst-case vs. Average-case:</strong> Protecting against pathological inputs limits performance on typical inputs.
      </p>
      
      <div class="proof-sketch">
        <p><strong>Robust Design:</strong> Algorithms that work well for all possible preference profiles may be overly conservative for realistic preferences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Performance Cost:</strong> Adding robustness against strategic manipulation or extreme preferences often reduces efficiency for "well-behaved" cases.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Auction mechanisms that prevent collusion may be unnecessarily complex when bidders are honestly competing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Design Question:</strong> How much performance should we sacrifice to handle edge cases that may never occur in practice?</p>
